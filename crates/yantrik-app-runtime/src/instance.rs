//! One window per app.
//!
//! The launcher, the taskbar pins and the companion can all ask for "notes" within the same
//! minute, and without this each request would spawn another process with another window.
//! The guard is a pid file under the runtime dir: the first process writes its pid, later ones
//! find a live pid there, ask that process to show its window (`present`), and exit.
//!
//! Exiting alone was not enough. The shell raises a window only if its compositor lists one, and
//! a copy a mind opened is drawn in Mind View, where the person's compositor never sees it: the
//! dock answered "accepted", the second copy left, and nothing appeared. The first copy owns the
//! window and is the only process that can show it, so it is asked, and what it answered is said.
//!
//! A stale file (the previous instance crashed) is detected by checking that the pid is still
//! alive, so a crash never locks the user out of an app until reboot.
