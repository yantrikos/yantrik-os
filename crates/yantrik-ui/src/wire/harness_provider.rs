//! Settings → Harnesses: "Use a provider" and "Revert provider" on a harness row, and the same
//! two for agents (`assign_provider`, `revert_provider` in control.rs).
//!
//! What the person answers is the plan's own card (`provider_handoff::Plan::card`). Between the
//! two presses this holds only which harness, which provider and the card's text — not the plan,
//! which carries the key. Apply plans again and refuses if the card would now read differently
//! (a changed provider, address or model), so what was read is what is done; an agent's call is
//! held to its approval card's sentence the same way. The rows pick up the change on the page's
//! own refresh.
