//! What the desktop knows about each channel a person can reach it from, how a message from one
//! is answered, and how a card is answered from the phone (design/channels-2026-09-29.md).
//!
//! **Who answers a phone.** Only the built-in companion (Pranab, 29 Sep 2026). It holds its own
//! tools to `Safe` for the turn (`Turn::is_remote`), so a stolen phone is not the person at the
//! keyboard. A mind with a shell of its own — the Mind, Hermes, pi — cannot be held to what a
//! phone may ask, even running as its own account: it could start a command that waits out the
//! hold, or act with another of its agents' tokens. When such a mind is the answering one, the
//! phone is told it answers only at the desk, and nothing is sent to it.
//!
//! **Answered later.** The router asks one message at a time, so a turn from the phone is answered
//! on a thread of its own and its answer sent when it comes ([`Outbox`]): a mind waiting on the
//! person's Allow must not hold up the very message that carries it.
//!
//! **Cards on the phone.** The machinery for answering a card from the phone — a one-time code,
//! `ALLOW 123456` / `DENY 123456` from the same identity in the same conversation, once, before it
//! expires; never for what cannot be undone or runs commands as the person; only on a channel the
//! person trusts with an Allow — is built and tested, and waits for its first caller: a card path
//! for the built-in companion's own tools, which today simply stay read-only from a phone. It is
//! the one place other than the card's own buttons that answers a card, and it answers only for
//! the person: the words come from their identity on the channel, which no mind can write as.
