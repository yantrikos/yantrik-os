//! An agent's commands, on the shell's surface: `agent_run`, `agent_job`, `agent_input`,
//! `agent_kill`.
//!
//! The terminal itself — a PTY per command, the directory that carries, the process groups, the
//! built environment, the caps — is `yantrik-agent-terminal`, tested without a shell. This module
//! is the door: it reads who is calling, turns the call's agent token into an agent, and hands the
//! work to the terminal off the UI thread. See `design/agents-workspace-2026-09-23.md`, decision 3.
//!
//! # Who the agent is
//!
//! Never an argument, and the token that says it is not one either. The token the host gave the
//! agent's harness with its first turn rides on `app.act` BESIDE `args` — `{action, args,
//! agent_token}`, the way a grant does — and reaches these handlers as `control::agent_token()`.
//! It is kept out of `args` because `args` is what gets shown and kept: the approval card draws
//! them, `record_unasked_action` writes them to `mind-audit.jsonl`, a grant is bound to them. The
//! runtime strips an `agent_token` a caller puts inside `args` anyway.
//!
//! The resolver checks the token against the kernel's account of the caller: the pid on the socket
//! has to descend from the harness that holds it. [`serve_host`] installs the shell's one —
//! [`HostTokens`], over the harness host — when the host is made (`wire/harness.rs`). Before that,
//! the resolver knows no tokens, so every call is answered "no agent holds this token": inert, but
//! a real answer.
//!
//! # A command that finishes after its call returned
//!
//! `agent_run` answers `running: true` when its `wait` runs out, and the agent goes on with its
//! turn. When that command ends, nobody's call carries the end — so the agent is told in its next
//! turn instead: the desktop leaves it a note (`Host::note_for`) that rides in that turn's context.
//! Which ends are owed is decided from what each agent was last *told*: a job whose last answer
//! said `running` is owed its end, unless the agent is waiting on it again (`agent_job`,
//! `agent_input`, `agent_kill`), in which case that call's answer carries it. See [`Late`].
//!
//! # Off the UI thread
//!
//! A command can take minutes and its caller is owed the exit code, so each handler only reads its
//! arguments, the caller and the token on the UI thread and hands the rest — resolving the token,
//! starting, waiting, killing — to `control::answer_later`, which finishes it on the socket's side.
