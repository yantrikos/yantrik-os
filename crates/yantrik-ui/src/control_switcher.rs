//! The window overview (Super+Tab) on the shell's control surface, and the glue that draws it.
//!
//! The overview, the keys inside it, a click on a cell and `yos act shell open_switcher` all end
//! in the functions here, so what a pointer can do a mind can ask for.
//!
//! # This is not Alt+Tab
//!
//! Alt+Tab is labwc's own window cycling (`config/labwc/rc.xml`, `NextWindow`/`PreviousWindow`):
//! hold Alt, tap Tab, release Alt to switch, in the compositor, so it works when the shell is
//! busy, hung, held by an approval card or gone. An earlier version bound Alt+Tab to this card and
//! lost all of that: labwc never tells a client that Alt came up, so release did nothing, and a
//! shell that could not answer left no Alt+Tab at all. The look people want from Alt+Tab is the
//! themerc's `osd.*` block. This card is a separate overview on Super+Tab that never stands in for
//! the native path; Enter or a click switches, Escape puts it away.
//!
//! # Off the UI thread
//!
//! Nothing here waits on the compositor on the UI thread. Opening reads the window stream's copy
//! (`toplevel_watch::windows`, no process), or `wlrctl`'s list when the stream is off, then raises
//! the shell; switching activates a window and learns whether it was still there. All of that is
//! a worker's job, finished on the socket's side with `answer_later` and published to the card
//! with `upgrade_in_event_loop`. Every compositor request is bounded (`windows::ask_compositor`,
//! 1.2 s each), so a stuck compositor is an error in the answer, not a frozen desktop.
//!
//! The windows are not captured: the compositor's window stream carries titles and focus, not
//! pixels, and no capture path for a single toplevel exists in the shell. Every cell shows its
//! app's icon on a neutral tile (alt_tab.slint).
//!
//! Left out on purpose, and said in `describe`: Mind View scope (a desk's own windows and a way
//! back), the workspace in the footer, and previews.
