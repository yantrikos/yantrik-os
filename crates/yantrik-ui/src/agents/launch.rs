//! Starting an agent, saying more to one, and stopping one — through the harness host.
//!
//! The host issues the conversation (`Host::start_agent`), addresses each turn to it
//! (`Host::send_to`) and stops it (`Host::stop_agent`); this file records what it did in the store
//! and hands the answer to `feed`, which reads it into the agent's session. A harness that holds
//! one conversation has the one agent `<harness>:main` — the same conversation the Lens has with
//! it — and a New agent on it continues that one rather than pretending to open a second. The
//! built-in companion answers in the Lens and holds no agents; the host refuses it, and so does
//! this.
//!
//! Each act comes in two forms: the one the screen calls, on the shell's own host, and `…_on`,
//! which takes the host — what `shell.new_agent` and friends call, and what their tests drive
//! with a host of their own.
