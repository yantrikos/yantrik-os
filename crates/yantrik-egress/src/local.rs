//! This machine's own addresses — never a destination — and the network it is on.
//!
//! Loopback is refused by its range, but a service bound to 0.0.0.0 also answers on every other
//! address the machine has (`192.168.4.44`, a docker bridge), and traffic to those stays on this
//! machine. Asked of the kernel (`getifaddrs`) at most a second before each connection, so an
//! address that came with a new network is refused within a second of existing.
//!
//! The home network is not only the private ranges. A dual-stack home gives every device a global
//! IPv6 address from the ISP's prefix (2a02:8070:abcd:1::20 is the NAS), and some homes and most
//! servers sit on a public IPv4 subnet. So these are the local network too ([`place`]), whatever
//! range they are in:
//!
//! - every prefix an interface of this machine is on (its netmask);
//! - every prefix the kernel routes straight out of an interface, with no router (a DHCPv6-only
//!   network gives a /128 address and the /64 only as such a route) — no wider than /48 (IPv6) or
//!   /16 (IPv4), never the /0 default, and never out of a point-to-point or tun device, so a VPN's
//!   `0.0.0.0/1 dev tun0` never makes the internet the home network;
//! - the /56 around each global IPv6 address of this machine on a shared network (not a
//!   point-to-point or tun device: a VPN's address says nothing of who is near), which covers the
//!   other /64s of a prefix the ISP delegated (the camera on `…:2::/64` while the desktop is on
//!   `…:1::/64`) and at worst refuses a neighbour the rules then name with `lan: true`. It is a
//!   guess, so it is said: in the control socket's `status` (`assumed_links`) and in the refusal
//!   of an address that is the home network only by it ([`Net::assumed`]);
//! - every router a route sends through.
//!
//! The routes are every table's, IPv4 and IPv6, asked over netlink (`crate::netlink`); when
//! netlink will not answer, `/proc/self/net/route` (IPv4's main table only) and `ipv6_route`, and
//! that is logged.
//!
//! Read with the addresses ([`Watch`]): at most a second old, so a network change is seen within
//! a second; a read that fails — the addresses, or the routes (any error but a missing IPv6
//! table) — keeps the last one that did not. A connection that leaves from an address the read
//! did not know has the network read again then (`crate::proxy`), so a new network is not the
//! internet for that second.
//!
//! Known limit: the router's public WAN address (a request to it hairpins to its admin page)
//! cannot be known here without asking something outside, and nothing is asked; it is the
//! internet to this proxy.
