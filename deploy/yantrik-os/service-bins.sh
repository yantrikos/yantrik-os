# service-bins.sh — the binaries the workspace's services build, asked of the manifests
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Prints one binary name per line. Exits non-zero if it cannot read the list, because a
# deploy that silently gets no services reports success and leaves the machine without
# them — the copy loops that consume this skip a binary that is not there, and the shell
# registers its services whether or not the binaries ever arrived.
#
# A service is a workspace member under services/ that carries a yantrik.toml manifest,
# and its binary is the [service] `binary = "…"` in that manifest — the same manifests
# start_services (crates/yantrik-ui/src/main.rs) scans on an installed machine, so the
# list that ships is derived the way the shell itself finds services. A member without a
# manifest is a helper the shell never registers — perception-journal sits under
# services/ and carries none — and is skipped rather than failed over.
#
# That is the rule deploy.sh, its BUILD_ALL branch and scripts/publish-components.sh
# were each expressing by hand, and the copies disagreed with each other: BUILD_ALL, the
# branch meant to build more, built two services fewer than the default, and a channel
# published with publish-components.sh carried a shell that registered `a11y` and
# `perception` with no binaries behind them. Nobody writes the list down now; a new
# service under services/ is built, deployed and published by existing code.
#
# The shelf still wins: callers drop what shelved-bins.sh names, the same way they
# always did.
