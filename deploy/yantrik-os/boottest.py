"""Boot a Yantrik OS ISO and make it answer for itself. The gate between "built" and "published".

    boottest.py <iso> <outdir> [--expect-git REV]

An ISO that was assembled is not an ISO that boots, and the first public image was checked by
hand: start QEMU, log in on the serial console, ask. This is that, scripted, with the answers
turned into assertions — so a pipeline can refuse to publish an image that reaches a login
prompt with no desktop behind it, or one that has picked up a private address again.

It talks to two unix sockets on this host — the guest's serial port and QEMU's monitor — and to
nothing else. The guest has no network (`-net none`), which also proves the image needs none
to reach its first screen.

Exit 0: every check passed.  1: a check failed.  2: it never reached a login prompt.
Leaves in <outdir>: serial.log (everything the machine said), screen.ppm, report.json.
