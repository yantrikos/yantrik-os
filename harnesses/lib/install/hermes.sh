# Hermes itself first, when it is not here, by Hermes's own installer: it fetches a pinned,
# hash-checked uv and Python into ~/.hermes, clones Hermes into ~/.hermes/hermes-agent and puts
# `hermes` in ~/.local/bin, all without root. `--non-interactive` because this runs from a
# button with no terminal; the two things it then skips (choosing a model, and the gateway
# service) are done below or named at the end. The browser and computer-use tools are left
# out: this desktop is the tool surface Hermes drives, and Chromium alone is a large download.
# Either can be added later with `hermes pm install agent-browser` / `cua-driver`.
#
# Then the desktop plugin, copied into Hermes and enabled, and Hermes's gateway, which is what
# loads the plugin and so what attaches to the desktop.

# afterwards, as it would for anyone. (Release tags carry an older installer that stops on a
# machine with no C++ compiler, which this image is.)
