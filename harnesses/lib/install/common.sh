# The Install button on Settings > Harnesses runs one of these as the person, with no terminal
# and no root, and streams what it prints into the row. So every line printed is written for
# that row, and everything lands in the person's home:
#
#   ~/.local/bin    the one place a harness's command is put. The desktop looks here as well as
#                   on PATH (crates/yantrik-ui/src/harness_catalogue.rs, `user_bin_dir`), and
#                   each harness's unit puts it on PATH, so nothing depends on a login shell
#                   having read ~/.profile first.
#   ~/.local/node   Node, when the machine has none new enough. The image ships none.

# env_line FILE KEY VALUE — set KEY=VALUE in a dotenv file: the KEY= line is replaced in place,
# or the pair appended when absent, every other line kept as it was. Hermes 0.21.x reads its
# authorization flags from its own .env before a plugin loads, so hermes.sh writes one there.
# The umask 077 subshell means the file is never readable by others, at no moment, even when it
# is being created; the temp file next to it and the mv mean a reader sees the old file or the
# new one, never half of either. The value is only ever written, never printed, and the line is
# matched on `KEY=` so a key that only shares a prefix (FOOBAR for FOO) is left alone.
