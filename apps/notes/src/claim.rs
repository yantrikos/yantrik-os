//! One copy of Notes per library.
//!
//! The framework's instance claim keeps one copy per app and profile. A vault needs more: two
//! copies on one vault share its journal (`.recovery-v2/pending.json`), so one's save removes the
//! other's, and one starting while the other saves replays that journal as a duplicate note. So
//! Notes also holds, for the life of its model:
//!
//! - the lock every build before the framework took, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/yantrik-notes.lock`, so an
//!   old build and this one keep each other out, whichever started first. Only the default profile
//!   keeps that name: another profile is a second instance with a library of its own, and locks
//!   `yantrik-notes.<profile>.lock`, so the first profile running does not keep it out (#976);
//! - a lock inside the vault itself, `<vault>/.notes.lock`, so two profiles pointed at one vault
//!   (`YANTRIK_NOTES_DIR`) keep each other out too. The library lists only `.md` files, so it is
//!   never a note.
//!
//! A lock that cannot be taken at all (no runtime directory, a vault that cannot be made) guards
//! nothing and stops nothing: the library's own errors say what is wrong with it.
