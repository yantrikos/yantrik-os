//! More than one window (design/notes-gate-2026-10-21.md §2, "Views and windows"; §3, gate row
//! "Two document contexts").
//!
//! - *Open in new window* (the note header's button, Ctrl+Shift+N, `open_in_new_window`) shows a
//!   note in a window of its own. A note two windows show is one document: what is typed in one is
//!   drawn in the other, and they share its unsaved state, its conflict and its draft. Each window
//!   keeps its own view of it: caret, scroll, search, dialog and undo history.
//! - A command from a window acts there, and that window is the one the person is in
//!   ([`arrive`]). A store job's outcome, a file seen changed, or a window's close asked for from
//!   the taskbar or the window manager is applied in the window it is about ([`applies_in`]), and
//!   the focus goes back to the person's window after: a window closed in the background never
//!   moves the person's focus.
//! - A window closing takes only its view with it ([`forget`]): a note no other window shows is
//!   closed then, and its file no longer watched.
