//! The only code that changes the model: every button, intent, timer tick and landing from the
//! engine's desk arrives here as a `Command`, and asks for its effects.
//!
//! The person's buttons and the Mind's intents are the same commands, so a person and an agent
//! cannot get different answers about whether something worked. The engine's calls run on the
//! desk (`calls.rs`); what they found comes back as `Landed`. The workers move bytes on their own
//! threads and bump the engine's revision; a look at it (`sync`) every 250 ms while anything is
//! running draws the list when that revision moved, and nothing at all otherwise.
//!
//! - `calls.rs`: the calls to the engine, and their answers.
//! - `life.rs`: the close and the logout.
//! - this file: the window's own state, the landings and the look at the engine.
