//! An app's settings: typed, versioned, and never lost (design/app-framework-2026-10-21.md, §6).
//!
//! The store owns the *committed* value: what is durably on disk, by revision. The app's model
//! holds the value it is using. A change goes through a command (`fx.save_settings`), the
//! write goes through the ordered persistence lane, and the result comes back as an event. A
//! failed write keeps the desired value in memory and says so; it never rolls the model back.
//!
//! The file is the app's own, `Paths::config_file`, in the marked envelope [`file`] describes.
//! A missing file is the defaults, unwritten. An older schema is migrated and rewritten once. A
//! file that is malformed, from a newer schema than this app knows, or not this app's at all (no
//! mark, or another app's) puts the store in **recovery**: the app runs on the defaults, a
//! problem record is filed, and no save writes over that file until the person chooses to
//! replace it (`Store::take_over`), which first sets it aside beside itself. A file that is not
//! this app's is never read past its mark, and only its path is ever said.
//!
//! Settings an app kept at the old shared place are brought across once by [`former`].
