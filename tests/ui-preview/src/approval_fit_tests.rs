//! The largest approval card a request may make, in both places it is drawn, at any window size
//! (third and fourth security reviews of #639). `approval_bounds` in the shell refuses a request
//! whose rows would not fit and cuts what is drawn to the same limits; the card itself never grows
//! past the room its host gives it, keeps Decline and Allow inside that room, and — when even its
//! pinned lines do not fit — scrolls everything above the buttons and holds Allow until the end
//! has been in view.
//!
//! This draws a card at the request limits — eight forty-character names, every value carrying
//! control characters drawn as escapes, the rows at the whole budget, three discrepancies, the
//! open-ended warning, the app's word about the call and the session row — in the top-right corner
//! of the whole shell and in the Lens panel, at the window size it is given (validate.sh runs
//! 800×600, 1280×720 and 1280×800). Decline answers inside the window, above the dock, and inside
//! the panel. Where the card had to scroll, Allow is disabled — a click on it grants nothing —
//! until the card has been scrolled to its end, and then it answers. At 800×600 the corner card has
//! to scroll. Then the vault prompt beside it, which must not lie over the card. Then the same card
//! in an agent's pane (approval_pane_tests).
