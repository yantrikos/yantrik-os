//! The longest real approval card in the Lens (#218), drawn by the production components at
//! 1280×800 and answered with real pointer events. `shell.run_recipe` publishes the longest
//! description of any action on this desktop; its card — the paragraph, an agent row, two
//! arguments, the session row — used to come out taller than the Lens panel. The panel's layout
//! ran out of room at the bottom: the reply box went off the edge and Deny/Allow showed as a
//! 3px sliver nobody could press. The card now keeps the height its panel allows. Since the
//! design sign-off of 4 October (item 6) the part that yields is the provenance at the top — who
//! is asking, the action's name, Details and source — while the consequence rows, the warning and
//! the buttons stay whole under it; `run` checks each of those is drawn above the buttons in the
//! Lens, and checks the rest at the card's natural height.
