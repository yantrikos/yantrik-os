"""Where an agent's LibreOffice work is done: a LibreOffice of its own, in a sandbox (#942, #953).

The person's LibreOffice runs with all of the person's rights. Whatever a document in it asks for
(a formula, a link, a macro, an import filter, an export) it reads and reaches as the person, so an
agent's calls never go there. They go to this one: headless, with a private profile and pipe,
started on an agent's first `open` inside the sandbox sandbox.py builds, through the launcher in
fence.py, which puts Landlock up inside where the kernel offers it and proves the sandbox holds
before soffice runs. It works on copies of the person's files (workspace.py, copies.py).

Where the sandbox cannot be built (no bwrap, user namespaces off, LibreOffice installed in the
person's own files) or does not prove, every agent call is refused with `CLOSED_TO_AGENTS` and the
reason, and nothing is started: there is no unsandboxed way round.

The UNO pipe: LibreOffice always makes its pipe in /tmp, and inside the sandbox /tmp is the
adapter's private `pipes` folder. Outside, the adapter pins the socket made there into a folder
the sandbox is not shown, checks who listens on it, and connects through a link in the real /tmp,
at the name a UNO client looks for, to that pinned socket (unopipe.py). Nothing inside can follow
it back out, or point it anywhere else.

The work folder is the sandbox's to change, so the adapter reaches into it only through
workdir.py, by handles, never following what it finds there.
